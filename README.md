Basketball website using mostly php and mysql


Basketball website where the user can create the profile of a player, a team, a tournament or an event. The schedule of the tournament is created automatically. Moreover, he is able to add the statistics of a tournament game, comment on a game etc. The design of the tables is not optimal (tables contain nulls, tables not in 4NF).

Some snapshots of the site might be added in the future.
